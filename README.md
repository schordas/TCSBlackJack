Overview
--------

I teach an entry level programming course to middle school students, this exercise
is geared specifically toward beginners starting at roughly a sixth grade level. 

This is a simple blackjack game made for teaching purposes for The Coding School.

This code is made for an exercise in teaching "if/else" statements.

The code is missing a series of if/elif/else statements necessary to determine whether the single player
or dealer won the game.
